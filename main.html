  <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

  <p>
    Time complexity is a way to describe how efficient an algorithm is in terms of time. An algorithm is considered efficient if it can solve problems quickly, even as the input size grows.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses during execution. A common example is an algorithm that uses O(n) space, where n represents the size of the input.
